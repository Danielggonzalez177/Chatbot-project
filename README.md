# Chatbot-project

## This project is just to test some functionalities and try to make a project with some rigor

### The idea and part of the code were taken from this [link](https://dzone.com/articles/python-chatbot-project-build-your-first-python-pro). Just be careful with deprecated functions


#### To run this project you will need to install some libraries. For that check the ``pypoetry.toml`` file and install the libraries that are mentioned there. You can also do it with a virtual environment and install the libraries if you have poetry already installed.

> [!WARNING]
> **I had a lot of problems with keras and tensorflow** It could be a good idea to run the code in colab to not have to deal with the installation of these libraries

#### To try the chatbot you can run the ``main.py`` file and start talking with the bot. You can also train the model again with the ``train_chatbot.py`` file. The ``intents.json`` file is the one that contains the data to train the model. You can add more intents and train the model again to see how it works.
