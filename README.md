# Chatbot-project

## This project is just to test some functionalities and try to make a project with some rigor

### The idea and part of the code were taken from this [link](https://dzone.com/articles/python-chatbot-project-build-your-first-python-pro). Just be careful with deprecated functions

[!IMPORTANT]
This project is not finished yet. I will try to finish it as soon as possible


#### To run this project you will need to install some libraries. For that check the ``pypoetry.toml`` file and install the libraries that are mentioned there. You can also do it with a virtual environment and install the libraries if you have poetry already installed.

[!WARNING]
**I had a lot of problems with keras and tensorflow** It could be a good idea to run the code in colab to not have to deal with the installation of these libraries
